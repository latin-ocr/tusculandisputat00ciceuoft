these philosophers. In de Off. iii. 33, 119, Cicero says of them ε qui
se dirempturos controversiam (Stoicorum et Epicureorum) putat-erunt,
*si cum honestate voluptatem, tamquam cum homine pecudem, copulat-issent.

Diodorus, a disciple of Critolaus, about 120 ss.c.

Aristonis, Pyrrhonis, see note to ii. 6, 15. According to Cic.
“ Acad. ii. 42, 130, and de Leg. i. 21, 55, Aristo diflered from Zeno
in considering all the ἀδιάφορα as equally indifferent. Pyrrho
thought that the wise man did not even notice the ἀδιάφορα
ἀπάθεια).
< Herilli. A native of Carthage, and disciple os Zeno. De Fin. v.
25, 73: Herulus scientiam (ἐπιστήμην) summum bonum esse defendit,
nec rem> ullam aliam per se expetendam

evanuerunt. De Off. i. 2, 6 : Aristonis, Pyrrhonis, Herilli jam
pridem eaplosa sententia est. These principles were afterwards revived,
with certain modifications, in the Christian Chureh.

obtinere, see note to i. 12, 26.

explicata is an adjective, “ clear :'' so p. Plane. 2, 5, caussafaoilis
atque explicata,- ad Att. ix. 7, 2: (litteroe tuoe) quibus nihil potest esse
explicatius, nihil perfectius. Distinotus and its opposites (constan-eston-
tortus, Sec.) are employed in the same manner.

proeter Theophrastum, for excepto Theophrasto, not usual in good
prose. Cf. 9, 24, and 25.

ticet, i. e. according to their principles.

exaqqerent, see note to 18, 51.

ea· collatione, “ by comparison ’⁷ (with virtue).

conterere, to tread as it were under foot ; an elegant antithesis to
ad ooelum efferre.

87. horum ratione, according to the system of the Peripatetics.

in taurum, sc. Phalaridis. Cf. 26, 75.

Xenocrate, Speusippo, Polemone. These three belonged to the old
Academ ⁷.

lonqe Ξῖ retro ponenda (-- postponenda). Instead of the corrupt
MS. reading, lonye et retro ponenda‚· or perhaps it might be better
to cancel et altogether instead of substituting any* other word for it.

habere se anqustius, “ to be in a greater dilemma 3⁹⁵ enatant, ‘⁶ flounder
through.'' The only instance in which the word is used meta-

horically.

P desertum, because none of the later Acad. adopted his views re-
specting the summum bouum.

eorum bonorum (according to Non. and the MSS), of “such goods
as these‚” viz. those goods, the possession of which constitutes true
happiness, and which are closely connected with honestas. The anti-
thesis is ea quce bona—videamur. Bentley's conjectural emendation
of rer-orum b. is unneeessary, Cicero having previously spoken only of
true goods, which are sufficiently indicated by eorum honorum.

Ep. voluptarios.
