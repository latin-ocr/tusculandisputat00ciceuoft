domesticis-ornamentisque. Cicero’s domestic happiness was de-
stroyed by the death of his daughter, and his politica] prospects
ι blasted through the supremacy of Caesar.

XXXV. 85. stlecellus. Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, who,
aster the overthrow of Andriscus, 148, made Macedonia a Roman
province, was Consul in 143, and lived to see the same office held
by three of his sons, viz. Q. C. M. Balearicus, 123, L. C. M. Diade-
matus, 117, and M. C. M. 115. His fourth, C. C. M. Caprarius,
was Praetor (and also Consul in 113, after his father's death) 3 Cicero
therefore collectively calls them honorati, i. e. honoribus functi.—T}¹e
ablat. above are abl. qualit.—-The sense is, ‘⁶ Even if some feW, like
Metellus, were snatched by death from the enjoyment of perfect
happineSS, it is equally certain, on the other hand, that most men,
like Priam, have been withdrawn by it from present or future mis-
ortune.'

πεντήκοντά μοι ἦσαν, ὅτ’ ἤλυθον υἷες Ἀχαιῶν·
ἐννεακαίδεκα μὲν μοι ι’ῆς ἐκ νηδύος ἦσαν,

evitari, a word which had become obsolete in the classic age of
Latin literature. It is derived from rita ·: vitam cripi. Observe also
the παρὴχησιςε ‘ci oetam evitari. The older poets were fond of such
alliterations. Cf. 44, 105: Vidi videre,- ii. 17, 39: paratam pestem
ut participet parem, iv. 36, 77: major >mihi moles, majus miscendum
malum. For a similar instance of ὁμοιοτέλευτον in the three verses
see 28 69.

ista 3ci, sc. that by which his life was taken.

Ῐιοσ autem tempore, when Troy was taken.

nimirum (see 22, 52), “ of course,'' ‘⁶ naturally,’' spoken somewhat.
contemptuously3 the inhabitants of the small eities were sure to
imitate those of the great ones.

Groeoulnm, “ truly Greek ''—“a regular Greek affair,” in a dis-
paraging sense, as in pro Flacco, 10, 23: motus quidam temerarius
Groeculoe contionis. The liveliness of the Greek character was dis-
tastesul to the grave Romans.

oum socero, with Caesar, whose daughter -Julia married Pompey, in
59. She had been dead since 54, or perhaps longer.

liberi defleti, sc. a Pmnpeio, who, after his defeat, must have ex-
pected nothing but misery and disgrace for his sons. The other
reading, deleti, does not make sense3 for they outlived their father
(Sextus outlived Cicero also), and Cicero is speaking here of the mis-
fortuues which Ponipey had experieneed in his lifetime, not of those
which befel his sons after his death.
