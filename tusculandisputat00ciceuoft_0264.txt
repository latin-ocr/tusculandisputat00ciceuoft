256 NOTES. [xxxv. 75, 763 xxxvl. 77,

non convalescentes, whose strength is not yet restored, after an
attack of illness.

75. clavo clavum. So also in Greek proverbially: ἥλῳ τὸν ἧλον,
παττάλῳ τὸν πάτταλον (sc. δεῖ ἐξελαύνειν).

ut, si jam. On account of the parenthesis (si jam-turpitudo)
Cicero does not go on with the construction belonging to ut (ut—
perturb. ipsa—per se sit), but begins, for the sake of greater perspi-
cuity, a fresh sentence with sed ut. For sijum see note to 31, 65.

accusabilis, ἅπ. λεγ.

76. illa, quoe, indications of insanity‚ like those mentioned in the
previous chapter.

injuriae, &c., from Ter. Eunuch. i. 1, 14 sqq. Cf. the fine passage
in Hor. Serm. ii. 3, 260 sq.

Suspiciones, here, and in many other places, with the second
syllable long.

ratione, “ rationally ;’' cum ratione, “with (sound) reason,'’ “by
rule.”

dicam, sc. recte.

nisi-voluntariam, see 31, 65.

XXXVI. 77. Ira vero. Another anacolfithon, the predicate to ira
being wanting, although the long parenthesis renders the sentence
sufficiently clear. Attempts have been made to restore the regular
construction by cancelling quoe,· but the words ira dubitationem in-
sam'ae non habet cannot possibly be the principal sentence, for Cicero
is here endeavouring to prove of ἱνιι, as he did before of amor, which
is an insania, that it is neither useful nor natural. The interrupted
chain of reasoniug is not resumed, therefore, until cap. 37.

dubitationem insanioe non habet, in a passive sense, dubitari non
potest, quin insania επὶ,- as de Off. iii. 2, 9: alterum potest habere dubi-
tationem—alterum dubitari non potest ,· de Fin. v, 12, 34: quoe corporis
sunt, ea coqnieionem habent similiorem, “ are more easily perceived.'’
So honorem, invidiam, fldem habere, &c.‚ sometimes in au active, and
sometimes in a passive sense. Cf. iii. 13, 27.

Quis homo, &c. The author of these verses is not known, perhaps
they are from the Iphigenia of Naevius or Ennius. The first verse
is spoken by Agamemnon, the second by Menelaus. The e must be
elided in te before exsuperavit.

intorquentur. Cf. iii. 26, 63: qnoe verba contorquet!

Major, δια, from the Atreus of Accius The verses are also
quoted in de Nat. D. iii. 26, 68, and de Orat. iii. 58, 219. For the
παρὴχησις see i. 35, 85, at ‘ei vitam evitari.

miscendum malum, according to the anulogy os ‘cenenum miscere.
So in Cat. iv. 3, 6: nota quaedam misceri oc concitari mala jampridem
videbam. Observe also the zeugma: as ter moles we must understand
mot-enda, or something of the sort.

Qui,abl. for quo, as Nep. Arist. 3, 2: ut, qui efferretur, vix reli-
querit.

malis mandarem. This is the reading of the best MSS.‚ here and
in de Orat. iii. 58, 217, where the same verses are cited. So Lucr.
ii. 638: Ne Saturnus eum malis mandaret adeptus. ,Malis mandarem,
the other reading, is also less poetical.

quo non—eodem—qu0—, “in which anger does not proceed to as
