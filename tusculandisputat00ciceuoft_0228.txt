220 NOTES. [x. 233 xx. ΧΠ. 26,

latius aliquanto, viz. to the end of the book. Aliquanto is an
intermediate expression between paullo and multo, and consequently
is milder than multo, which is Cicero's real meaning. Some MSS.
have aliquando, which also makes sense. Cf. i. l, l.

nihil. See note on i. 2, 5.

mediocritates, “moderate affections.” Cf. 31, 74. Acad. ii. 44,
135: ,Mediocritates illi probabant, et in omni permotione naturalem
volebant esse quendam modum.

maynum est, is nonsense.

corporum statui ,· as at i. l, 2: cum Groecia sunt conferenda.

elata etyesticns, ‘⁶ an extravagant feeling of delight, expressed by
passionate gestures.’' Cf. ii. 24, and iv. 6, 12.

nomen—a dolere, “is an idea which cannot be separated from
pain.'' (Sejunqere, in prose, is always followed by a.)

XI. 24. partibus. Pars (not species), in Latin, is the usual oppo-
site of yemis. So v. 25, 71 : qenera partesque virtutum.

isque motus—citetur. Citare, “to call forth,'' would seem (except
in this instance, and at i. 10, 20) to be used only with reference to

ersons.
p altera is subject, voluptas yestiens (dici potest) predIcate. The abl„

afterwards.

25. bonorum opinione turbantur, a b1ach3100x for bonorum opinione

in vita hominum (in all the MSS.), “ in the life of men‚” i. e. “as
long as they are capable of acti0n;” for so long only can stul-
titia assume a practical form. Imminere is used here absolutely,

sequently the conjectural emendation in vitam must be rejected.

omnibns viribus atque opibus: “ with ·ill the force (within us) and all
the resomces (which exist extraneously).' ’ In the same sense, ad
