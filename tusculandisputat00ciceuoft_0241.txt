ἱιιεῖεηη iv. 38, 83; animi morborum una sanatio est, omnes opina-
· sesse.

Cleanthi, see note to ii. 25, 60. For the variation in construction

ut Cleanthi placet—ut Peripatetici (sc. dieunt), cf. Acad. ii. 39, 124. ·
ν ut Platoni placuit—ut Xenocrates.

nihil mali, evidently a corruption, for this would be simply a repe-
tition of the topic of consolation chosen by Cleanthes. As the names
of different schools of philosophy are appended to the other opinions,
Davies (1 eferrmg to 13, 28, and 22, 52) proposes to substitute nt
Cyrenaici for nihil mali.

Chrysippus. Cf. note to i. 45, 108, and' 1ii. 22, 52.

in tumore, “ ferment‚'' “ agitation ;'' as at 12, 26.

tn eo, not animo, but tumore.

AEsolcyli. Prom. Vinct. 377. Oceanus speaks:

Οὔκουν, Προμηθεῦ, τοῦτο γιγνώσκεις, ὅτι
Ὀργῆς νοσούσης εἰσὶν ἰατροὶ λόγοι,

and Prometheus answers·

Ἐάν τις ἐν καιρῷι γε μαλθάσσῃ κέαρ
Καὶ μὴ σφριγῶντα 9υμὸν’ ισχναὶνῃ βίᾳ.

Siquidem, “ yes, if —,' ’as at ii. 17, 39, qui- - quis.

XXXII. 77. altera, supply disputare, from the following ,τὶ-εἰε-
d· utandum.

ωέἱᾱείαν vidisse. This is the usual position of the two words when
they occur in the same sentence. It is only when ‘ridere is a vox
praegnans, - —proesens (coram) videre, that it is placed first; e. g. de
Fin. v. 2, 4: Modo enim suit Carneades, quem ‘cidere videor.

ea: eo ipso, viz. from one ’s own moral vileness. '1¹0 a man, who is
distr essed about this, the consolation offered by Cleanthes· 1s of course

Socrates Alcibiadi. Augustino, de civ. Dei, xiv 3: Alcibiaden
ferunt, quum sibi beatus videretur, Socrate disputante et ei, quam miser
esset, demonstrante flevisse. Cicero has either borrowed this anecdote
from some source unknown to ue, or has dressed up Plato’ 5 descrip-

(consequently a. Peripatetic), was celebrated for his eloquence. He
wrote a treatise “ on the supreme good and the supreme evil. ” He
died Β. c. 225.

Ad Ep. consolationem, see i. 4, 8, note to ad id.

XXXIIII. 79. non tibi hoe soli, sc. accidit ; a common topic of con-
solation among the ancients. So Euripides:

Γίγνωσκε τάνθρώπεια μηδ’ ὑπερμέτρως
Ἀλγει, κακοῖς γὰρ οὐ σὺ πρόσκεισαι μόνη.

Ovid: Solamen miseris, socios habuisse malorum.
