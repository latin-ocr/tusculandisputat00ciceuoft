subj. perf. of pass and dep. verbs is never employed by Cicero in this
sense.

’ XXIV. 56. Quid? introduces the next question, with which a
fresh argument begins.

sanquinem, bilem—dicere, unde concreta sint. This sort of attraction,

s viZ. the adding as the object of a verbum sentiendi aut declarandi, on
which an interrogative sentence depends, the word which, strictly
speaking, ought to be the subject of the dependent sentence, is de-
rived from the practice of ordinary life, and therefore frequently
employed by comio writers, but more sparingly by Cicero and good
prose aut-hors. Cf. ad Fam. viii. 10, 3: nosci Marcellum, quam tardus
sit ; de Invent. ii. 57, 170, >eim rei, qualis et quanta sit, ooynoscamus.

animum ipsum, si nihil esset in eo, an anacoli’ithon, sor in animo ipso
si m'ln'l esset, evidently occasioned by the construction of the preceding
sentence, Nam sanquinem, &c. Cf. ii. 16, 37, Militiam tero.

hoec enim for has enim, generalizes what has been said, “things of
that sort.'' Cf. iii. 4, 7.

57. Habet primum. The corresponding sentence is 25, 61, Quid?
illa vis, &c. Cf. 13, 30.

nisi recordari. Plat. Menex. p. 81. Cf. also Phaedr. p. 249 G. and
Cic. Cat. M. 21, 78.

in eo sermone, Plat. Phaedo, p. 72, Ε.

coynoscere, from the Cod. R. 1, for the usual recoqnoseere (which is
always equivalent to recensere). So ξ 58, tum agnoscit illa reminis-
vendo,

ἐννοίας. This term belongs in strictness to the Stoics, rather than
to Plato and his school. The former, it is true, admitted innate
ideas, but considered them not as expressions of the ἀνάμνησις, but
as the result os sensible impressions.

58. Quumque nihil esset, &c. Nihil, nothing of that which we per-
ceive by means of the senses ; esse (here, and twice in the paren-
thesis) is equivalent to vere esse.

Quod semper, δια, an abbreviated expression for quod semper tale
sit, quale est: quod (or quam) ἰδέαν appellat ille. Cf. Acad. i. 8,
30: Mentem volebat rerum esse judicenz; solam censebat idoneam, oui
mederetur,- quia sola cerneret id, quod semper esset simplem et unius
modi et tale, quale esset. Hanc illi ἰδέαν appellabant, jam a Platone ita
nominatam ‚- nos recte speciem possumus dicere.

hoec—aqnoscere. Hoee and coynwiza are the ἰδέαι .· αρηοεεενε in this
passage is equivalent to ooynoscere ; but immediately afterwards it is
used by Cicero in its ordinary acceptation-

Neque z neque vero. η

59. memoriam. Cicero here, and in the remainder of the treatise,
takes memoria in its ordinary sense, as signifying “ memory.”

Simonides of Ceos, the famous Lyric poet, who lived at Athens in
the time os Hipparchus and the Persian war, is said to have been
the inventor of innenionics.

Theodectes of Phaselis in Asia Minor, a disciple of Isocrates and
Aristone, was celebrated as an orator. Cf. Quintil. xi. 2, 51 z Quin
{lemel auditos quamlibet multos versus protinus dicitur reddidisse T lieo—

ecles.

&ineas of Thessaly was also distinguished as an orator. Cf. Seu.
