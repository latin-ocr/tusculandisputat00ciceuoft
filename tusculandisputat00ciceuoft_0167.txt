INTRODUCTION. 159

The leading idea of the work is this : That the grand aim of every
man is happiness, and that the most essential requisite for the at-
“ tainment of this happiness is peace of mind ; consequently we should
endeavour to subject all our feelings and (lesires to the controul of
reason, and to put away from us every thing which ean disturb
’ our equanimity. Το this end, Cicero, in the first book, argues
against the sear of death3 in the second, teaches that bodily suf-
fering, even if it be an evil, can and must be endured with patience
by the wise 3 in the third and fourth, instructs us in the best mode
of overcoming, or at least moderating, the assaults of grief and other
passions calculated to distnrb our peace of mind3 and finally, in
the fifth book, proves that virtue is in itself sufficient to insure a
happy life.

The Tusculan DisputationS‚like all the other philosophical writings of
Cicero, dex-ive most oftheir arguments from Greek sources. In the first
book (in the chapter concerning immortality) he has borrowed freely
from Plato and Aristode, whssst, in the second, and still more in the
third and fourth, he has recourse almost exclusive-ly to the writings
of the Stoics, especially Chrysippus. The contents of the fifth book are
an amalgamation of the doctrines of the Peripatetic and Stoic schools.
Wherever he is unable to coincide with his teachers, he does not
scruple to take the field against them. This treatise, like the other
philosophical works of Cicero, is in the form of a dialogue ; but instead
of following (as he does in his Academica, de Natura Deorum and de
Finibus) Aristotle's plan of letting first one of the disputants‚ and
then another, state without interruption his views,and the arguments
by which they are supported, he here adopts the Socratic method of
taking each particular separately, and exhausting one subject, by
means of question and answelg before he proceeds to the discussion
of another. This plan, however, he has carried out but imperfectly
(as compared with Plato„ for, after the introductory dialogue, the
subject is discussed almost exclusively by the principal character (the
Magister), whose lecture is only interrupted by the exchange‚ from
time to time, of a few words with his hearers. The Tusculana>
must be considered in the light of a popular, rather than a strictly
philosophical treatise‚ full of noble thoughts and admirable rules of
eonduct‚bnt deficient perhaps in logical closeness of reasoning. The
style, although now and then elevated, is, generally speaking, even
more simple and familiar than that of his other philosophical
writings, and, in some parts, exhibite traces of the haste with which
the work was composed.
