4. Atque ii quidem = et tamen ii. Cf. iv. 31, 66 z Atque erat facile,-
34, 71 z Atque horum omnium, &c.

’ feruntur, in the sense of the compos, auferuntur Ξ abripiuntur, as
at c. 5, 11.

continuit, prop. “meets with‚’' expresses an intimate connexion
‘ between the event and the person, so that the former corresponds
with the subjective or objective relations of the latter (cons. for the
most part employed in bonam partem). Accidit, on the other hand,
is used to express unforeseen contingencies, which for the most part
are unfortunate.

III. 5. et before morbi, particula pendens. Cicero intended to say
(with reference to the preceding utrum—an), et morbi—corporis, et
medicina certior est morborum animi quam corporis, but falls, after a
somewhat lengthened exposition of his first point, into an anacoluthon.
Qui vero, &c. Cf. 26, 63, et AEschines; iv. 35, 74, et illud.

probari ut -—. An abbreviation of the phrase, ut credam (credamus).
We have a similar use of ut with tenere (v. ll, 34), “to abide by
one’s opinion ;'’ and effe-ere, “ to prove.’'

se sanari voluerint. See i. 41, 98.

6, omnibusque. After the negat-ive the Latin writers, especially
Cicero, often introduce the antithesis with a copul. instead of an
advers. particle. Sed is corrective; et simply places the positive
proposition next to the negative 3 que (and so) introduces the one as
the consequence and result of the other; and atque, ac (and much
more) appends it, in order to increase the intensity. Cf. i. 29, 71 ;
v. 10, 30.

opibus viribus. The proverbial expressionS‚ equis viris and ventis
remis, “ with might and main,'’ osten occur without quc.

cle universa philosophia, “respecting philosophy in general.” Cf.
ii. 2, 4, universoe philosoplzioe vituperatoribum iii. 6, ll, Totum iy‘itur
iel—quid sit ,- 6, 13, dc omni animi perturbatione.

nec scribere. He alludes especially to the Academica, and the
books definibns bon. et nial.

7. in Academiain—descendimus. See note to ii. 3, 9.

caussam disserendi, prop. “an occasion,” i. e. “a theme for dis-
putation.’⁷

IV. cadere. Cadit aliquid ‘in aliquem means, one meets with
something so as to have a part in it. So in consuetudinem nostram
non caderet, ‘⁴ that would not agree with the usage of our language.''

somnidines, &c. An incorrect enumeration. At 5, 11 we have the
more accurate division and subdivision of the perturbationes. See
iv. 7, 16.

Hoec enim. The neuter used, as at i. 24, 56 (after vitis and arbor).

eqo poteram morbos. Cf. de Fin. iii. 10, 35: ( perturbationes ani-
morum) θηρσὶ πάθη appellant, poteram eqo verbum ipsum intevpretans
morbos appellare ,- sed non conveniret ad omnia.

verbum e verbo, “ word for word,’' “ literally‚’' = ad verbum, 19, 44.
Cicero is again mistaken (as at ii. 15, 35, with regard to πόνος
