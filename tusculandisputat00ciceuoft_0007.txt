PREFACE.

DR. TISCHER’S edition of the Tusculan Disputations
is included in Haupt and Sauppe's “ Collection of
Greek and Roman Authors with German Notes.²’
It will be found a very useful edition, tho remarks
being clearly and accurately expressed, and the
amount of them very judiciously proportioned to the

real wants of the student.
