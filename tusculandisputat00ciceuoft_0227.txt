17. reliqua ‘igsitur est. This is Madvig’s conjectural emendation of
the MS. reading, reliqua iqitur et quarta ‘cartus ut sit 'ipsa fra-q. It
is more simple than Kiihner’s ε rel. iq. et qu. virt. erit ipsafruy.

18. ab eo—ab e0. Id is repeated in the same way, after an inter-
mediate sentence, at 28. 71; and z's after Oileus ille at 29, 72, to render
the passage more intelligible.

nequicquam. So Varro, L. L. X. ξ 81 M.: ex ne et quidquam,
media extrita syllaba, coactum est nequam. This is a mistake, ne-
quam and nequitia are derived from the same root as nequire.

nihil is, it is true, no where else used in the sense of nequam (nihil
es in Div. in Caecil. 14, 47, and ad Fam. vii. 27, 2, signifies, “you
are utterly insignificant ¹''). We find, however, in Greek, the phrase,
ὁ, ὴ οὐδὲν, a good-for—nothing person. Some of the MSS. have nihili,
which Moser has retained, because in Varro, 1, l, we have, Itaque ut

eum, quem putamus esse aon hili, dicimus nihili, sio, in quo putamus
esse non hili, (licinius nequam.

20. Etenim does not here introduce the proof of Qua—vacabit, but
a new proof of the assertion, caritudine sapiens vaeabit; conse-
quently it might be exchanged for porro or praterea.

invidiam. Cicero uses invidia only in a passive sense; to avoid
ambiguity‚ he employs the word invidentia to express the active
meaning. Cf. iv. 7, 16.
