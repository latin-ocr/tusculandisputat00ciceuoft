LIBER TERTIUS.
SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS.

ΤΗΕ Prooemium treats of the necessity of a medicine for the eure
of mental disorders, and recommends philosophy as such (cap. 1-3).

The subject of the Disputatio itself is the thesis Cadit in sapientem
oeyritudo, which Cicero briefly refutes ; in the first instance after his
own fashion (cap. 4—cap‚ 7, ἓ l3)‚and then by five arguments of the
Stoics (cap. 7, ξ 13—cap. 10, ἓ 21).

This prepares the way for a more extensive examination of the
doctrine of oeqritudo generally (ξ 22 and 23).

Ι. Concerning the origin of (egritudo. [Em-itudo, accord-
ing to Cieer‚o originates, like the othe1 perturbationes, in the imagi-
nation (opinio) being the vivid (recent) representation of an evil
actually present, and of such a character as to justify uneasiness
(cap. ΙΙ) This definition is substantiated by proving—1.That
oeyritudo depends ou the representation of an evil, an argument
which overthrows the theory of the Epicureans and Cyrenaics (cap.
12-22). 2. Thai, it is something voluntary‚ the result, in most
instances, of a mistaken sense of duty, and consequently not founded
on the nature of things (cap. 23—30). 3. That it arises only from
the recent representation of an evil, and therefore is not agreeable
to nature (cap. 31, ἓ 75).

II. Concerning the grounds of consolation. Attention is
at the same time directed to the contente of the next book (cap. 31,

ἓ 76-cap. 34).

Ι. l. ejusque utilitas—consecrata, for eaque propter utilitatem diis
inventoribus adscripta ideoque sacra habita. Cf. p. sest. 68, 143: im-
mortalitatis opinionem in illo sanctissimo Hercule consecratam videmus,
cujus corpore combusto eitam ejus et virtutem immortalitas excepisse
dicitur. The dii immortales in this passage are Apollo and his son
AEsculap ius.
