LIBER QUARTUS.
SUMMAR.Y OF THE CONTENTS.

AFTER some preliminary remarks on the history of Roman civiliza·
tion (cap. 1—3), Cicero introduces the Disputation on the thesis, Non
omni animi perturbacione sapiens potest vacare. It consists of three
parts :-1. Classification and definition of the four perturbationes and
their species, according to the Stoical system (cap. 6—14). 2. Refu-
tation of the thesis itself, with an especial reference to the doctrine
of the Peripatetics, respecting the necessity and utility of the pas-
sions (cap. 15—26). 3. statement of the means to be employed for
resistiug them (cap. 27- 38).

1. 1. multis locis, ‘⁶ in many points of view.''

in iis studiis, δῖα, viz. in doctrinae studiis (see ἓ 2).

provocationes, sc. ad populum. That the same right of appeal
existed under the monarchy we learn from Cicero, de Rep. ii. 31, 54.

dii-initus and dii-ine, in the sense of praeclare, are not uncommon in
Cicero.

disciplina ac temperatione cii-itatis, “ the order and organization of
the state ;‘' see note to i. 10, 21.

de re publica scripsimus, B.c. 54. The two first books of this work,
of which only a few fragments were previously known to the moderns,
have been almost completely restored through the exertions of
Anuelo Mai.

2⁶. illis poene in conspectu. So Cat. M. 21, 78: Pytkaqoram Pytha-
yoreosque, incolas poene nostros,

quifuit, &c. C-f. i. 16, 38. The birth of Pythagoras is fixed by
different authorities at various periods, from B.c. 605 to B.c. 570, and
his death from Rc. 497 to B.c. 472.

auctor nobilitatis tuoe, ‘⁶ the founder of your noble family.'⁷ So
Brut. 14, 53: L. Bruto illi, nobilitatis cestroe principi. Nobilitas has
two different significations in the same sentence (praestanti nobilitate
Pythaqoras), cf. i. 23, 54: omnisque natura consistat necesse est—ham·
naturam animis esse tributa-nm Cat. M. 6, 19: Quoe (i. e. consilium,
ratio, sententia) nisi essent in senibus, non summum consilinm majores
nostri appellassent senatum. This irregularity often occurs in Cicero.

ad after clausus, according to the analogy of disputare ad aliquid,
and the like, see i. 4, 7.

3. N umam—Pythagoreum. Liv. i. 18, rejects this myth (bor-
rowed from Ovid, Met. xv. and Fast. iii. 153) as an anaehronism, but
speaks of Pythagoras as a contemporary of servius Tullius.

ΙΙ. Vestiqia anteon, &c. That the vestiges of Pythagorean lore, to
