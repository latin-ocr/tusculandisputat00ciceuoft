1. 1—3.] Boox 1. 161

aliquando in Cicero generally signifies “ at length,'’ with the addi-
tion sometimes, but very rarely, of tandem.

pertinerent—contineretur. After a perfect, even in such dependent
propositions as are applicable to the present or all other times,
Cicero osten employs the imperfect of the subjunctive. Thus 4, 7 :

- hano—judicari, ‹Ince—posset dicere, and dedimus, zat—auderemus,-

42, 100, multaverit, quam— possem dissolvere.

quoe logically refers to studio, grannnatically to philosophia. So
iv. 10, 23 : morbi, qztoe vocant illi νοσήματα.

‘non quia—sed. Non. quo (quod, quia) followed by sed without quod
(quia) [not that (or as)-—but because], so that the second clause assumes
the form of a principal instead of a relative sentence, is by no
means uncommon in the writings of Cicero (cf. ii. 26, 6-1; iii. 22,
54, &0.).

sapientius quam Grcecos. Cf. de Orat. i. 4, 15: Ingyenia nostrorum
hominum multum ceteris hominibus omnium yentium proestz'terunt. An
exaggerated statement, the result, not so much of Cicero's vanity, as
of a desire to encourage the Roman student.

2. melius—lautius, “ more carefully and with greater elegance.''

certe intimates that the management of matters of state policy was
less satisfactory in the speaker's days.

quum ‘cirtate,—tzcm-disciplina. That the Romans were brave
above all other nations was universally acknowledged. Cicero here
asserts, that they were no less remarkable for their military
seleuce.

illa—cum Grcecia—-sum conferenda. An abbreviated comparison
(comparatio compendiaria), of which many instances may be found
in Greek as well as Latin writers, e. g. in the next sentence, and in
de Orat. i. l.

3. Homerus—Hesiodus—Arckiloclzus. Homer, according to most
authorities, flourished between B.c. 1000 and 900. Hesiod of Ascra,
the poet of the ἔργα καὶ ἡμέραι, about B c. 800; and Archilochus (the
writer of satirica! Iambics) in the reign of the Lydian king Gyges,
consequently about B.c. 700 (see Herodot. i. 12) z according to
Corn. Nep. under Tullus Hostilius ap. Gell. N. A. xvii. 21.

Annis fere DX p. R. c., or more accurately speaking, 514 (3.0. 240),
as Cicero especially mentions in Brut. 18, 72, in the consulship of
C. Claudius Centho and M. Sempronius Tuditanus.

Livi-us fabulam dedit. Livius Andronicus, a native of Tarentum,
was not only the oldest dramatic poet among the Romans, but their
earliest writer. Fabulam dare (sc. populo, like yladicctores dare) is
less common than fabulam docere (sc. histriones), e. g. b. iv. 29, 63.

Ennium. Q. Ennius of Rudiae, in Calabria, was born B.c. 239.
Horace (Ep. ii. l, 50) calls him alter Homerus. He wrote eighteen
books of Annales (an historical Epos founded on Roman history) in
hexameter verse. He died B.c. 169.

qui cannot here refer to Ennius3 for he was younger than the
comic poet T. Maccius Plautus, who died Rc. 184, and Cn. Naevius
(a writer of tragedy, comedy, and epic poet-ry, whose chef-d’oeuvre
wasa poem on the Punic war), who died in 204. It must belong,
therefore, to the principal person of the sentence, Livius. Why
Cicero here mentions parenthetically the difference between the age
