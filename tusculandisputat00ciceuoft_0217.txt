cannot endure the pain. Suppose our whole body were full of aches,
how should we behave then 3⁷’ [Fac z yrant,· suppose]

fluimusque mollitia. So Vell. i. 6, and ii. 88, mollitiisfl.; Liv. vii.
29, luxu fluere. More commonly diffluere.

53. ut supra dixi. See 15, 35.

tulit dolorem, &cu The difference between cir and homo is exhibited
here in a stronger light, by means of the chiasmus. Cf. ad Q. Fr. ii.
ll, 3: ‘cirum te putabo-hominem uon putabo. We have the same
story at greater length in Plut. Mar. e. 6.

animum comprimit. Animus is here taken in its more restricted
sense z ὁ Θυμός, passion, ira (i. 10, 20). So p. Marc.3, 8 : animum
vincere, iracundiam cohibere—lawe qui jaciat, eum simillimum deo judico.

23, oeyr'is corporibus—animi oeyritudo: iv. 10, 23, moa-bis corporum—
mo‘rborum animi. In 17, 40, we had the plur. animi with the sing.
cor us.

idque raro. Cat. M. 18, 65: Severitatem in senectute probo et eam
modicam, acerbitatem mallo modo, where et is improperly altered into
sed by some commentator-s.

duodecim tabuloe. According to Cic. de Leg. ii. 23, 59, the words
of the law were to this effect : Mulieres yenas ne radunto neve lessam
funeris erqo habento. It has been proposed, though very unneces-
sarily, to substitute lessus for fletus in the passage now under con-
sideration.

56. Nec—ne—quidem. See note to 23, 53.

‘venitque playa vela. Cf. p. Caec. 26, 74 : Major hereditas unicuique

XXIV. exclamare majus, besides the analogy of the Greek phrase,
μέγα βοᾶν, has the authority of Plautus (Mil. iii. 2, 10: maynum
clamat,· Most. ii. 2, 57 ; exclamat maximum) and Gellius (v. 9:
maynum inclamare). Notwithstauding, however, these examples,it is
so unusual in prose, that we should be inclined to prefer ηιαρὶε,
although that reading has less authority on its side.
