time of Romulus) was indebted solely to Cato for a notice of those

with other popular ballads, formed the groundwork of what is generally
called the History of the Roman Kings.

Fabio. Q. Fabius, grandfather of the historiam although of a
noble family, was employed to paint the temple of Salus B.C. 304, and

Polyclitos et Parrhasios. Parrhasius of Ephesus flourished as a.
painter about B.c. 400. Polyclitus (or PolyclEtus) of Sicyon, as a

Lepidum, &c. Μ. AEmilius Lepidus Porcina (Consul n.c. 137)
