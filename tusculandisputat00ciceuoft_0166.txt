the truth, was the business of Cicero in his character of a philoso-
phical writer: and it is this spirit of inquiry which renders his
writings so valuable to modern readers, as containing a short but
complete analysis of all the most considerable philosophieal systems
of his time. Writing, as he does, not for any particular school of
philosophers, but for educated men in general, we find him endea-
vouring to bring the dogmas of philosophy into accordanee with the
sentiments of every-(lay life ; and, with this view, placing before us
a variety of opinions, to each of which hc assigns its due prominence,
without pledging himself to the adoption of any one in particular.
At the same time we find in most of his writings a logical closeness
of reasoning, the result of his study of the writings of Plato and
Aristode, and his exercises in the Stolo system of Dialectics. His
object was to give, iu a series of Latin treatises, a summary of the
different systems of philosophy. After producing, therefore, as we
have already mentioned, two political philosophie-al works, he pro-
ceeded,in thc year B.c. 45, to lay the first stone of a inore systematic.
plan, by the publication of a treatise called Hortensius, in which hc
proves the advantages of philosophica} studies in general.

This was followed by his essay de Academicis, in which he discusses
the theoretical question, ‘⁶ What is true 2³³ and declares himself a
favourer of the doctrines of the New Academy. In examining (in
his books de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum) the practical question,
‘⁶ What is good 2⁷² he is forced to aclmoffledge, that the Epicureans
are in errour when they assert that the highest good consists in
ἡδονή, and that, on the other hand, the Stoics‚ who hold moral good
to be the only, and the Academics and PeripatetieS‚ who believe
it to be the chief good, are both substantially right, although they
differ in their mode of treating the subject.

These works were succeeded by his Disputationes T asculanae, and
at a later period hy his treatise de (ffciis. ·

The Tusculan Disputations were connnenced in the latter half of
the year 45 (as we infer from the mention made in them of the
other works published in the same year, e. g. the Ilortensius and
Academica, ii. 2. 4. the Consolatio, i. 26, 65, and iii. 28, 70, the books
de Finibus, v. ll, 32. Cf. also de Divinae. ii. l. 2),and finished perhaps
in the beginning of the following year. Before the death of Caesar
they had become well known (Cf. de Fato, 2, 4 ε ad Att. xV. 2, 4,
and 4. 2).

The name is derived from the circumstance (related by Cicero
himself, i. 4, 7 and 8) of their being written in consequence of a
five days' disputation, held by Cicero with several of his young
friends at his Tusculanum, a country—seat noar Tusculum (now
Frascati). Instead of the original title (Quwstiones Tusculanae)
modern editors have adopted that of Disputationes, a name re-
peatedly given to the work by Cicero himself (cf. Tusc. v. l, l, de
Fato, 2, 4; ad Att. xv. 2, 4, and 4, 2). The ancient grammarians
(Nonius, Priscian, and others) call them, sor brevity's salte, simply
the Tusculanoe. They are dedicated to M. <Iunius Brutus (the
famous conspirator against <lulius Caesar) who, in the earlier part of
his life, had been a diligent attendant on the lectores of the Greek
philosophers, aud had himself written some works on the same subject.
