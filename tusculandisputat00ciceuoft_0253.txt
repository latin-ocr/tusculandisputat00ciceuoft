v, 39, 115: cum ariete colloquentem facit ejusque laudare fortunas.—
A different account is given both of the crime of Tantalus and his
punishment. Cf. i. 5, 10.

Ob scelera, &c., from an unknown poet.

- superbiloquentiam, ἀκόλαστος γλῶσσα, at the table of the gods.
According to other authorities it was the murder of his son Pelops,
the purloining of nectar and ambrosia, for the use of other
mortals, ἃς.

aliqui—terror, see i. ll, 23, at deus aliqui.

36. ad fruyalitatis nomen, see iii. 8, 16, where Cicero pronounces
franca-litas to be the best translation of the Greek word σωφροσύνη.

virtutes, se. omnes.

Stoici. Diog. L. vi. 105 z σοφὸς ἀναμάρτητος. There is a full
account of the Stoica] doctrine in de Fin. iii. 22, 75, and 76.

XVII. 37. sibique ipse. We should have expected ipsi here, but
see Zumpt, ἓ 696.

is est sapiens. Is is a repetition of hic, sor the sake of perspicuity
and emphasis. Cf. iii. 8, 18. ”

ad demitt. animum—act ffrendum, here in the sense of a consecu-
tive sentence. So 38, 82: dolore ad patiendum lez-ato.

Nam quid, διο. seems to refer to human happiness, and qnid enim,
διο. to human miscry.

animo—emcubac. There is the same figure in Phil. iv. 7, 18: Quam
ob rem, Quirites, consilio quantum potero, labore plus pcene quam potero,
excubabo riyilaboque pro vobis.

nihil improvisum, “ nothing which he did not expect ” (Nihil
improvisi, nothiny out of the sphera ofwltat is uneaepected.)

38. videat, “look about for.’⁷ Cf. note to iii. 19, 46.

apte (from the old verb apere, ἅπτειν, to join) answers here
exactly to our English word “ fitly.”

mollis—Perip. ratio. Cf. iii. 10, 22.

ratio et oratio, “ opinion and expression,” a frequent association in
Cicego, for the sake, no doubt, of the ὁμοιοτέλευτον, like gyratis et
suavis. Cf. 28, 60.

quem ultra, anastrophe, as at ii. 6, 15, hanc post. The only other
instances of this use of ultra are in the poets and Tacitus.

39. aut—mente vim constes -· aut pertimescas, ne opprimare. Cicero
is thinking here of oeyritudo and metus (the order being reversed), as
he was before of cupiditas and Ioetitia.

die, see iii. 30, 74, note to in die.

40. in quo has been adopted from the MSS. of inferior authority,
instead of the vulg. in quo, because the sense requires a reference to
the combined idea, quoerere modum oeyritudinis.

ponitur, sc. α Peripateticis.

P. Rupilius Lupus was Consul with P. Popilius Loenas, B.c. 132.
Lael. 20, 73: Scipio P. Rupilium · potuit consulem efficere, fratrem ejus
Lucium non potuit. Plin. H. N. vii. 36: (P. Rupilias) morbo Zem'
impeditus, nunciata fratris repulsa in consulatus petitione, illico exspi-
ravit. This brother, Lucius, had been Praetor 'm 146. We may
easily recognize here the dialogic form in which Cicero combats the
doctrine of the Peripatetics.

C'. Fannius Strabo, a disciple of the Stoic Panaetius, sou-in-law to
