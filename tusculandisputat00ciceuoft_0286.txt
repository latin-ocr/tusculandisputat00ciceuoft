principem, see note to i. 15, 34.

epistola Platonis, concerning the assassination of Dion (B.c. 353),
the seventh of the spurious Platonic epistles ; in other respects it is
well deserving of the epithet proeelara. The prepositions ad and a
are added to epistola and littei-ce, without any verbal form. cf. i. 22,
51 at sine.

'Quo quum venissem. He is speaking of his first visit to Sieily; see
note to iv. 19 44.

Italicarum ’Syracusiarumque mensarum. Italian and Syracusan
tables were proverbial iu Greece, in the same way as the term
Sybarite is still used to express an effeminate person. Aristoph. ap.
Athen. xii. 6: Συρακοσίων τραπέζας Συβαρίτιδάς τ’ εὐωχίας. The
form Syracusius (au imitation of the Greek) is used by Cicero only
here and de Off. i. 44, 154: syracusiam Dionem. In the poete we·
often meet with Syracosius.

Σύριοι, ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν βαρβάρων Ἀσσύριοι ἐκλήθησαν. So Strab. xvi. l,
repeatedly. Cic. de Fin. ii. 32, 106. Suet. Caes. 22.

Hoec habeo, &e. Strabo, xiv. 5, gives us at full length the Greek
imitation of this epigram, of which Cicero has translated two verses:

Εὖ εἰδώς, ὅτι θνητὸς ἔφυς, σὸν θυμὸν ἄεξε

Τερπόμενος θαλίῃσι· eandum τοι οὗ τις ὄνησις.

Καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ σποδός εἰμι, Νίνου μεγάλης βασιλεύσας.
Ταῦτ’ ἔχω, ὅσσ’ ἔφαγον καὶ ἐφύβρισα, καὶ μετ’ ἔρωτος
Τέρπν’ ἔπαθον· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ καὶ ὄλβια πάντα λέλειπται.
’Ήόε σοφὴ βιότοιο παραίνεσις ἀνθρώποισιν.

direetly from the author. Cf. de Fin. ii. 32, 106.

&quis—ludis is the dat. in answer to the principal question, Cur

fruuntur.
