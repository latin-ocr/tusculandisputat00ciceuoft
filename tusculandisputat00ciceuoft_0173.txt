porta Capena (now the porta di S. Sebastiano)‚0n the southern side
of Rome, leading to the ria Appia. The Romans were fond of erect-
' ing monuments by the sides of the most frequented highways.

Calatini. A. Atilius, called Calatinus from his family connexion
with Calatia in Campania, was Consul in the years 258 and 254, and

” triumphed over the Carthaginians, as Dictator, in 249. The eloyium on

hismonumentisquoted by Cicer0,Cat. M. 17, 61 ; and de Fin.ii. 35, 116.

Serviliorum. The most celebrated were Cn. Servilius Caepio, who
was Consul in 169, and Q. Servilius Caepio, Consul in 106.

Metellorum. The most renowned members of this distinguished
plebeian family were L. Caecilius Metellus, who, as Consul, defeated
Hasdrubal at Panormus in 251, Q. Caecilius Met. Macedonicus
(Consul 143), and another of the same name (Consul 109).

verbo premis for the more usual expression uryes, an adaptation of
the military phrase (hostes premere).

in primis ‘⁶ among the first subjects which Dialectics teach.”

occurrit ut appellarem. Occurrit is the perf. logicum3 for an ac-
count of the subj. imp. see Zumpt. Gramm. § 514. Cf. de Fin. iii.
16, 33 : quod illi ἀδιάφορον dicunt, id mihi ita occurrit, ut indifferens
dicerem.

omne pronuntiatum. Cf. Acad. iii. 29, 95: Fundamentum dialec-
ticoe est, quidquid enmztietur (id autem appellant α’ξὶωμα, quod est quasi
e ffatu m) aut vei-um esse aut salsum.

id erqo est, διο. With erqo Cicero resumes the train of thought
which had been interrupted by the parenthesis. There, is how-
ever, an anacoluthon, for, strictly speaking, he should have con-
tinued : Omne pronuntiatum erqo verum est autfalsum.

VIII. 15. dejeceris. Like ii. 5, 14,q·uamumcle doloris terrore dejeceris.

Probably it was originally added as a gloss to calcem.

calcem. ln the circus at Rome the 90ch was indicated by a line
drawn anciently with lime (calar), and at a later period with chalk
(oreta). Hence the phrases ad calcem pervenire (Lael. 27, 101), ad
carceres a calce rei-ocari (Cat. M. 23, 83), &c.

Epicharmi. He was a native of the isle of Cos, but was brought
to Sicily in his childhood. He flourished, B.c. 480, as a Pythagorean
philosopher and Comic poet.

ut Siculi [: as was ιο be expected from a Siciliam} The ut here
gives the reason that makes the preceding assertion probable. So
(Dioyeues), ut Cynicus, projici se jussit inhumatum—The wit of the
Sicilians is often mentioned by Cicer03 e. g. in Verr. ii. 43, 95:
Numquam tam male esc Siculis, quia aliquid facete et- commode dicant.

Emori, διο. Sext. Empir. adv. Math. i. ἓ 273, gives the verse of
Epicharmus thus: ἀποθανεῖν ἢ τεθνάναι οὗ μοι διαφέρει. It was
undoubtedly in the first instance a tetrameter, which different com-
mentatore have endeavoured to restore each after his own fashion,
srom the passage before us. Sauppe: ἀποθανεῖν οὐχ ἁνδάνει μοι·
τεθνάναι δ’ ού διαφέρει. Cf. Plaut. Capt. iv. 5, 83 : Post mamm in
morte nihil est, quod metuam, mali.
