Charmadas, a philosopher of the Academy and disciple of Car-
neades, flourished about 110 13.C.

Metrodorus of Scepsis in Troas (also a disciple of Carneades) is
often mentioned as a. mnemotechnic philosopher, who ssourished
somewhat later than Charmadas (for which reason nuper is used with
reference to Charmadas, aud modo with reference to BIetrodorus). He
is called Scepsius to distinguish him from au Epicurean philosopher of
the same name, who lived at Lampsacus, and is mentioned ii. 3, 8
and 6, 17.

Hortensius, Q„ the rival of Cicero in eloquence, and somewhat
his senior, was born B.c. 114, and died 13.c. 50. Cicero says of him,
Brut. 88, 301 : memoria tanta, quantam in nullo coynorisse me arbitror,
ut, quoe secum commentatus esset, ea sine scripto verbis eisdem redderet,
quibas coyz‘tarisset. Hoc adjumento ille tanto sic utebatur, ut sua*
et commentata et scripta et nullo referente omnia adversariorum dicta
vtaeminisset.

XXV. 60. illa ris is here the animus in general, although Cicero
afterwards returns to the consideration of the memoria.

anima sit iynisce, not a. disjunctive question.

αι istos, all those who profess to explain tbe nature of the soul.

affirmare, “ to speak with certainty,’' which Cicero, according to

,the principles of the new Academy, was unable to do. Cf. 9, 17,
and 17 40.

sit. 'The subjunctive with sire—sire, because it is the dependent
clause os an oratio obliqua (as in 17, 40; and 43, 104); only one
should have expected the imperf. subj. Cf„ however, de Pin. i. 7,
25 : Nam si concederetur, etiamsi ad corpus nihil reseratur, ista sua
sponte et per se esse jucunda, per se esset et virtus et cogynz‘tio rerum
expetenda.

leoc—coelo, intimates the reason why the memory cannot be a pro-
duction of earth.

61. 'imprimi—animum. So v. 20, 5 : Quoe quum. riderem tot restiyiis
impressa, instead of quibus τοι 'resti-qia impressa, according to the
analogy of the double construction of the verb adsperyo, διο.

maynitudo, sc. memoriae quasi tabula> cereoe qicoe—-possit effi ηραν-ο
for -— efficta continere.

quoe ina-quoe—dicaur. Two relative sentences referring to the
same word are not very uncommon in Cicero. Cf. 43, 102 ; ii. 3, 7 and
13, 20 ; Cat. M. 17 , 59 : in eo libro, qni est de tuenda re familiari, qui
OEconomicus inscribitur.

Quid? illa ris, &c. See ξ 57, ειῬνὶηιηηι.

imposuit nomina. We find, nevertheless, among the ancients a
belief that the names of things originated not in Θέσει, as Pytha-
goras taught, but in φύσει. So Plato (in the Cratylus) and the
Stoics.

of the planets (of which Cicero also speaks. de Nat. D. ii. 20 aud 40—-
