of the Gods, as exponents of the doctrine of Epicurus. Most of
those whom we have mentioned were statesmen. It is a fact,
that to their public speeches in this character we are indebted for
whatever knowledge we possess of their philosophical tenets3 for
they contributed little or nothing directly to the dissemination of
scientific knowledge; the teachers of philosophy at that period
being almost without an exception natives of Greece, who em-
ployed, of course, their own language in their lectores and
treatises. The first publication of philosophical works in Latin
was undertaken by two Epicureans, C. AMArixius (or Amafunius)
and RABmius, of whom Cicero (Tusc. i. 3, 6 ; ii. 3, 7, 8 ; iv. 3, 6, 7) ;
because they were Epicureans, speaks much more slightingly than
they deserve: for however meagre these first essays may have
been, they were of no small importance in those days, as the means
by which the treasures of Greek philosophy were rendered accae-
sible to the people in general. The doctrine of Epicurus has
also been explained with considerable elegance and poetical skill
by Τ. Luem-:rius emus, in his didactic poem (de Rerum Natura),
which is still extant. Cicero, therefore, is incorrect in saying,
that until his time philosophy had never been exhibited in an
ornamental dress by any Latin writer3 although we cannot gainsay
the remarkable fact, that whilst not a vestige exists of earlier or
contemporary publications in the Latin language, Cicero, after a
lapse of nineteen centuries, continues to be our instructor in philo-
soph .

MyTUfflUS CicnRo was distinguished as an orator, a statesman,
and a philosopher; but the taient most peculiarly his own was his
eloquence, to the possession of which we may attribute, in a great
measure, the reputation which he enjoyed as a politic-ian and a
philosophical writer. The qualities with which nature had endued
him were of no common order. To the most exact knowledge of
mankind, without which no orator can achieve greatness, he united
the strictest probity, universal benevolence, fidelity to his family
and friends, the most enlightened patriotism, an ardent love of the
noble and the beautiful, and unwearIed activity of body and mind.
He would have been, not merely a brilliant, but a really great states-
man, if he had not wanted'that sels-reliance and strength of pur-
pose, so diffieult to acquire at all times, and more especially under
the circumstances in which he was placed. Deficient as he was in
this quality, we cannot be surprised at the weakness and indecision
w'hich he too often manisested in situations of difficulty and peril.
The same peculiarities of character, which distinguished him as a
statesman, rendered him also a brilliant desender aud propagator
of philosophical doctrines3 whilst the deficiencies which prevented
his attaining the highest eminence in that department were a fatal
obstacle to his becoming really great as a philosopher. The pecu-
liarities which we have mentioned furnish a key to the whole os his
conduct. As the native of a provincial town, without influential
family connexions, Cicero could look only to his legal and political
knowledge, coupled with his unrivalled eloquence, sor the grati-
fication ol' his ambitious longings. At the very commencement of
his preparatory studies, he had discovered that the orator, who
