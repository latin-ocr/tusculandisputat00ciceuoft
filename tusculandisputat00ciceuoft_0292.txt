sententia est, ut virtus—valeat, see iv. 21, 47, at ita definit, ut—sit.
Cicero afterwards uses the phrase omneque—esse dicant (not omneque
—sit)‚ to make the antithesis to quod vos dicamus more striking.

quid—faciendam, Mes. The vulg. reading is quid—jaciendum
putes? which Tregder, on account of the difficulty occasioned by the
subj., changes into the indic. The best MSS„ however, read vides,
which has been received into the text by Klotz and Kiihner, but
seems hardly reconcileable with their own interpunction (quid—-
faciendum vides? It should have been videtur). We therefore, with
Moser, take vides affirmatively, and complete the sentence by adding
sit to faciendum. The ellipsis of the verb esse also occurs elsewhere
in relative sentences, e. g. Orat. 12, 39: quorum satis amata multa,-
de Fin. v. 3, 7 : quorum princeps Aristoteles ,· Brut. 83, 286 : quorum
Charisius multarum orationum.

ad philosophice scriptiones, “to engage in philosophical writing.”
Most of the MSS. have ad philosophicas scr„ which is quite unclassical.
Some have philosophas, the use of which as an adjective is only ante
