de constanti riro-quoerimus The expression is borrowed from the
language of the courts (de pecuniis repetundis quaerere, de morte ali·
cujus, &c.). Cf. 27, 58, and 59.

ipsam illam iram, &a The sense is z As in a dissolute youth, who
is not under the controul of reason, affliction may be useful for his
,improvement3 so in war rage may supply the place of real courage
in the mind of the common soldier; but in the wise these passions
are out of place.

rhetorum—mysteria. The arts by which the disciples of the rheto-
ricians were taught to rouse and avail themselves of the passions of
their hearers.

XXVI. 56. (emulari, obtrectare, mise-reri, see 20, 46.

pro capet-ientia, “instead of trying it oneself.’'

57. quami-is fuse, not concessive (therefore with the indie.) but the
same as i. 21, 47, quamtis copiose.

sapientiam esse, ἃς. The same definition see v. 3, 7.

proemeditatum uon sit. These wordS, although not inlthe MSS„
are absolutely necessary to the sense. AttemptS, it is true, have
been recently made to explain the passage (without the words iu
question) by supposing an antithesis between accidit z ex improviso
et proeter spem fit, and evenit z ex rerum natura ct cum necessitate
quadam proi-enit, but how can accidere form a direct antithesis to
evenire? or how can it have this meaning at all, when tale, i. e. impro-
visum aliquid aut repentinum stands close to it. We have substituted
proem. non sit for the Vulg. ⁷1on proemium sit, because such an altera-
tion renders it easier sor us to explain how the words came to be
omitted. The transcriber’s eye no doubt passed over ηδ sit, coming,
as it did, immediately after possit.

quod aiunt, see 20, 46.

ex errorum radicibus, gen. epexegeticus. Cf. i. 36, 87, nomen carendi,-
iii. 6, 12, merces immanitatis.

XXVII. 58. quanta sint, quoe—remedia-adhibeantur, Cf. de Orat.
ii. 30, 132: illa qucerenda,quoe ‹tryumenta debent afferri. Zumpt, ἓ 814.

ut invenerit, ‘⁶ that she should have discovered [0r, according to our
frequent idiom; “as to discover ’'] (as to have discovered). The
subj. plusq. in such sentences would be bad Latin.

59. neque omnis oeyritudo, διο. Neque is the partic. pendens (as at
iii. 3, 5, and before morbi). The words, et in omnibus quattuor per-
turbationibus illa distinctio est, should follow, instead of which Cicero,
after the parenthesis, goes on with Est etiam, διε. So de Fin. ii. 22,
71 and 72: Nam nec cir bonus ac justus haberi debet, qui, nc malum
haheat, abstinet se ab injuria,- afterwards there follows, Quoe dici
eade m de ceteris virtutibus possunt.

miseranti. Festus: Miseracur is, qui conqueritur aliena incom-
moda; miseretur is, qui miserum sublevat.

adhibeatur oratio. Bentley conjectures curatio (as ξ 74, hoec adhi-
henda curatio est), a reading which is sauctioned by two MSS„ but the
curatio is effected by means of the oratio; and the phrase orationem
adhibere occurs also in other places, e. g. 29, 62, eadem sit omnibus
adhibenda oratio.

utrum illudue, see Zumpt, ἓ 352, gg. E. So above, 4, 9: Utrum
iqitur mavis statimne nos vela facere an paullulum remiyarc 2
