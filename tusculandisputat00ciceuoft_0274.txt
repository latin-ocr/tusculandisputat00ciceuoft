compleatur. Kiihner’s conjecture for the reading of the MSS.
(complectitur), ef. 16, 47 z sed his citam beatam compleri neyam.

41. atque munitum is not an independent member of the series, but
merely an appendage of soeptum3 hence the conjunction. So Lael.

ll, 36: horrida, inculta, abdita et opaca, and in many other places.
We have another instance of et before the last member of the sen-

metu praeditus. Cf. p. Flacco, 3, 6, levitate, eyestate, peffldhz, audacia,-
p. Sulla 3, 7, sinyulari immanitate et crudelitate‚· de Inv. i. 47, 88,
vitio orandi proedicus. lt is, however, more commonly applied to
good qualities.

qui parco metu est. The codd. have qni parca metuit ,· but Cicero
would certainly never have expressed himself so incorrectly3 for a
man who has little sear (aud that is undoubtedly the meaning of
the passage) would not dread parra, but only maqna. We have
therefore made this alteration iu the text. The older conjecture,
qui parum wzetuit, is irreconcileable with Cicero's usual mode of
expression ; for parum iu his writings is always = non sacis.

procul, here in the sense of an adjective, a somewhat harsh con·
struction.

42. sibi before in se posita is not a pleonasm, but is absolutely
necessary to limit the signification of omnia (z omnia sua).

An Lacedoemonii— ,· eir is? Conclusio a minore ad majus,
A similar construction with (ιη, 32, 903 p. Arch. 12, 30. Cf. ii.

quently z in bonis opinatis. Cf. i. 13, 30, at deorum opinio.

44. vulnerant, “they reckon ;” it occurs also not unfrequently
with a singular object, e. g. p. Mur. 24, 49: Sulpicium accusatorem
suum numerabat, 72on cmnpetitorem.

abundantem, see i. 38, 91, at judicantem.

45. An dubitas quin. Instead of concluding the sentence with
nziser sit, he begins it asresh with dubitabisne eum miserum dicere, for
the sake of perspicuity.

hebeti inqenio atque nullo. Observe the augmentative force of atque.
So de Leg. iii. 14, 32 : pauci atque admodum pauci‚· Orat. 16, 52:

beatum, substant. Ξ τὸ μακάριον, by way of variety for beata vita.
So de Fin. v. 28, 84 : virtutem, in qua sit *ipsum etiam beatum.
Cicero afterwards (de Nat. D. i. 34, 95) coined the words beatitas
and beatitudo.

XVI. 46. minima, “ things of very little account.”

candiduli dentes, the diminutive is here used jestingly—“ pretty
little white teeth.”

Anticlea was the mother of ulysses. Cicero has made a mistake ε
he meant to say Euryclea, his nurse.
