peated, unless we strike out quz' altogether.

quinta quoedam natura: that Cicero is mistaken in this notion ap-
pears from 10, 22.

inducta primum. This is also a mistake. The Pythagoreans had
already admitted a fifth element, which Philolaus names ἡ τῆς σφαί-
ρας ὁλκάς and other writers ἡ τοῦ παντὸς σφαῖρα. Cf. Sext. Emp.
adv. Math. x. 316: Ὀκελλος (Pythag3 490) καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης συμ-
παρέλαβον τοῖς τέσσαρσι στοιχειοις τὸ πέμπτον καὶ κυκλοφορητικὸν
σῶμα, ἐξ οὗ λέγουσιν εἶναι τὰ οὐράνια.

‘m Consolatione. This is one of the lost treatises of Cicero, com-
posed (B.c. 45) principally with a view to his own consolation after
the death of his favorite daughter Tullia. It is mentioned also 34,
83, and iii. 28, 70.

XXVII. 66. nillil ne-quidem. See 23, 53.

sola belongs not to quoe but to divina, consequentlyzquoe omnia divi-
nam solam οι-ἰρὶηειη habent.

67. Ubi iyitur, &c the objection of some imaginat-y opponent, to
which Cicero replies by a series of counter questions,

potesne z num potes, as in Cat. M. 16, 56 ε Poteratne tantus animus
non efficere jucundam senectutem? On the other hand in etiamne, i. 34,
843 rectene, iii. 17, 373 satisne, v. 21, 623 the ne Ξ nonne.

quoe habere vellem, i. e. si fieri posset (for which reason vellem is used
instead of celim). Cf. 11, 23, cuperem ; 33, 81, and 41, 98, vellem.

quamquam id quoque, sc. fieri potest.

motum, “ susceptibility of every impression.’'

Qua facie quidem est. Quidem gives prominence to the word to
which it is attached. If the sentence preceding it be antithetical to
this word, then it has the force of an adversative particle. So 41,
99, clii immortales sciunt ,· hominem quidem scire arbitror neminem ‚· 43,
102, Theodori quidem.

XXVIII. 68. Ut, quum ridemus. The corresponding sentence to
Ut, Sic. is, Sic mentem hominis, διο.

ad temperationem corporum. Cf. iv. 13, 30:002-p01-ts temperatio,

quasi fastorum. In apposition to luminis,‘ ‘which performs the office
of a calendar.''

qae, scorpius, arcitenens, caper, amphora, pisces.

quinque stellas: Mercur), Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.

‘in medio mundi Ioco. Cf. 17, 40.

duabus oris. In the two temperate zones. Cf. Ovid. Met. i. 48.

Sul> axe, &c. from the Philoctetes of L. Accius.

stellas septem, the seven stars (septem triones), or the Lesser Bear.

ἀντίχθιινη. Cf. de Rep. vi. 20, 21 : australis ille cinyulus, in quo
qui insistunt, adversa nobis uryent vestiyia; the country of the Auti-
podes (ἀντίποδες).

69. Coelum, διο. probably from the Eumenides of Ennius, a similar
passage occurring in the Eum. of AEschyffis, v. 907, of which the play
of Ennius was an imitation.
