Marius and Cinna. Cf. i. 5, 10, and v. 19, 55.

toto pectore, “ with the whole soul.’' So de Leg. i. 18, 49 z si non
ipse amicus per se amtur toto pectore, ut dicitur. Instead of ut dicmur,
when he cites a proverbial expression, Cicero sometimes uses ut (now

distinguish him from another of the same name mentioned at 11,26,
was a native of Hei-aclea in Magna Graecia, and diseiple of Zeno.

suffering, he went over from the part of the Stoies to that of the

which at that time induced him to alter his views3 but plurimos—
dolor refer to the present time.
