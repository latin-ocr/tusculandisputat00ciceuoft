a march !'’

cibaria, according to Caesar, B. Civ. i. 78, for twenty-two days; Liv.

plus—quam, for mayz's quam, as in Phil. xiii. 4: ‘me ejus beneficio
plus quam pro virili parte obliyatum puto; so especially non plus—-
quam, e. g. ad Att. ii. 1 med: Catonem non tu amas plus quam eqo.
[where quantity or (incoant is signified, plus is the regular form.]

38. experti sumus, in the civil war, where Pompey’s raw levies
were easily defeated by Caesar’s veterans.

O Patrocles, διο. This scene is from the Epinausimiiclaf of Accius.
The groundwork of the plot is furnished by Hom. Il. xi. 822, but in
many particulars Accius differs from him, or rather from his Greek
original.

potest, in the last verse but one,is read pot’st‚as 17,39, non potest ecfari.

Non—ewercitum. In order to restore the metre the editor has
cancelled est, which in all the MSS. follows quidem. (lt is worthy of
remark that one and the same interpolation is often found in all
the MSS. of the Tusc. Disp.) Exercitus, “affiicted,'' “torniented,” ef.
emacuit, v. 1, 3. [uttered by Patroclus, when he sees Euryphlus ap-
proach wounded. Orelli]

Ubi—continuatur, “who suffers under such an accumulation of
[uninterrupted] misery.'' We have followed the example of Klotz
in making these words a. part of the verse. Most of the editors
suppose the words to be Cicero’s‚ and F. A. Wolf translates them,
“in which passage P. so piteously bemoans his misery;’' but this
does not at all agree with what follows (si quidem homo esset, &c.).
Of the two we should prefer Kiihner's suggestion, who would make
the words a part of the next sentence, vide, ἃς. The sense would
then be, “Notwithstanding this accumulation of misery, he does
not utter any lamentations,’' &c.

XVII. 39. quam non, see note to 7, 17.

Eum, a monosyllable. Observe the alliteration in the sueceeding
words.

credo, “ Ι conclude‚'’ “ probably ;'' slightly ironical. There is also
a tinge os irony in what follows

Si quidem homo esset. So p. Flauo. 7, 15: O morem proeolarum disci-
plinamqw, quam a majoribus accepimus! Si quidem teneremus‚· sed
nescio quo pacto jam de manibus elabitur.

nihil minus, according to several MSS. Most of them, howevel,
have nihil vidzmus, probably a corruption of minus, and thence the
reading of ,nihil vidi minus. The verse is imperfect· ‚ perhaps it ran
thus: Eloquere, Eurypyle, διο.

potest, a monosyllable; ecfari, used in a passive sense.
