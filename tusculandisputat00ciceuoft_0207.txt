17; vn. 18, 19.] Boox 11. 199

Klotz (whose conjectural emendation we have adopted), omit the
word altogether. How easily might dulo have dropped out before
v dolorem! For sedulo, in a reproachful sense, ef. ad Att. iii. 12, l:
Τ u quidem sedulo aryumentaris, quid sit sperandum. Quoe ista (spes)
est, eodem tribuno pl. et inimico consule desiynato?

17. Metrodorus. See note to 3, 8. According to Clem. Alex.
Strom. ii. p. 498, his words were, Ἀγαθὸν ψυχῆς τί ἄλλο ἦ τὸ σαρκὸς
εὐσταθὲς κατάστημα καὶ τὸ περὶ ταύτης πιστὸν ἔλπισμα ; ef. v. 9, 27.

V11. Affirmat—dicet. The verb fin. dicet, instead of the inf.
dicturum esse, which, logically speaking, ought to follow affirmat.

exspectas—dum dicat. 'So Lael. 13, 44: ne exspectemus quidem, dum

homini—duro. The sense is, “ He, who is effeminate in every
thing else, would surpass Hercules himself in the endurance of
pain.'’ What a rough and harde-ned man !

in Phalaridis tauro. Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum, about B.c.
560, had a brazen bull, the work of Pei-illus, in which he used to
roast his victims. Cf. ν. 10, 31.

quam—non, “how little.” So 17, 39: vide, quam von flebiliter
respondeum,- iv, 35, 74: quam nihili sit omnino, ‘⁴ how valueless it is.''
Brut. 64, 228: quam boc scriptionis yenus nondum sic Latinis litteris
illustratum, “how little thus iar.''

illi ipsi, the Stoics.

contra naturam, adjective, as 13, 30. On the other hand, in ἓ 18,
we have naturce inimicum.

et before mal. omn. ertremum, “ and indeed‚” as ad Fam. ii. 7, 4:
a tribuno plebis et a Curio tribum),- p. Quint. iv. 14: moritur—et
moritur repentino,- p. L. Man. 18, 54 z mayna ac multo maxima.

18. ut dolor-em-wluptczrius .· that you should turn pain iuto pleasure,
by using the same words as Epicurus (Quam suave est l). To render
the contrast more striking, the words voluplalem a: =d homo—voluptarius
(“ a man, whose sole pursuit was pleasure ’⁷) are placed as near as
possible to one women—Efficias is T'auber's emendation of the vulg.
afficias. The sense is the same, but the latter expression is more
feeble than the other, eisdem verbis afficias being explained by eisdem
verbis appelles.

19. Philoctetam. He possessed the bow and poisoned arrows of
Hercules. In consequence of an oracle, which declared that Troy
could not be taken without those weapons, the Greeks brought him
as far as Lemnos, where they were compelled to leave him, on ac-
count of a noisome wound in one of his feet. After ten years of
tortum, he was removed from the island by Ulysses, after the death
of Achilles.

cui, sc. ut homini, as opposed to ipsum Herculem, sc. deum.

yementz' Ξ ywere, or ut qemat, a somewhat unusual Graecism. Cf. de
Off. i. 21, 71: iisforsilan concedendum sit rempubl. non capessentibus,
qui—doctrinae sese dediderant.

viderat. Diodor. S. ἰν. p. 243 ι Ὁ μὲν Ἡρακλῆς ἀπογνοὺς τὰ καθ’
ἑαυτὸν καὶ παρελθὼν ἐς τὴν πυρὰν παρεκάλει τὸν ἀεὶ προσιόντα
