· 19. Empedocles of Agrigentum flourished B.c. 460. We possess

some important fragments 0of his didactic poem περὶ φύσεως (in three

books). His words, Αἷμα γὰρ ἀνθρώποις περικάρόιόν ἐστι νόημα,

ν are to be understood as expressing an opinion that the heart’ 5 blood

was the seat of the soul. Critias, according to Arist. de Anim. 1, 2,
taught that the blood w as the soul.

Aliis tenere. “ Others have supposed that a portion of the brain is
the principal habitation of the soul ’² [lit. ‘possesses tlte ruliny-pozcer

the MS. R.-Cf. iii. 27, 64 ; res declarat.

nam—dictus est. The sense is: Anima signifies “the breath ;”
amincus, “the intellectual powers.” Both words have the same de-
rivation; consequently the Romans believed the soul to be breath
and air.

Zeno of Citium in Cyprus, founder of the Stoic school at Athens
(about B.c. 300), named the soul vrvn'lpa ἔνθερμον.

Χ. cor, cerebrum. I have expunged the intermediate sanquinem,
as it is only found in one MS. It accords less with rulyo than the
four other ideas.

of men, which we have just described, are very general : those which
we are about to mention belong only to individua} philosophers.

Aristode, wrote three books (still extant), περὶ ἁρμονικῶν στοι-
