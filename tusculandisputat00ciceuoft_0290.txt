Asclepiades of Phlius, the friend aud disciple of Menedemus of
Eretria, about nc. 300. Cic. Acad. ii. 42, 129: A Menedemo autm,
quod is Eretria suit, Eretriaci appellati, quorum omne bonum in mente
positum ac mentis acie, qua verum cerneretur. Cf. de Orat. iii. 17, 62.

puero—uno—comitutior. Comitatus is not unfrequently used by
Cicero in a passive sense. The custom of rich men being followed
by a numerous body of friends and parasiteS, gave rise to the joke
of Asclepiades, that his blindness had given him another attendant
(he had none before), viz. a boy to lead him about.

si liceat, se. parasitari. Cicero mentions this, that he may not
lower the numerous class of poor Greek scholars too much in the
eyes of the rich Romans.

subsidia valetudinum, ‘⁶ remedies in case of sickness.'' Tae. Ann.
vi. 50 z medicus-reyerc valetudines principis solitus.

114. Democritus, see i. ll, 22 ; de Fin. v. 29, 87 : Democritus (vere
salsone, uou quaeremus) dicitur se oculis privasse. The aneients had*
already begun to question the authenticity of this story, which no
doubt was a mere invention.

scilicet, when followed by an adversative particle, has a concessive
sense, like our “ to be sure.'' So de Fin. v. 1, 3 ; Me spectes quoedam
commovit, inanis scilicet, sed commorit tamen.

maynu partu, “important and unimportant.’' For the asyndeton
see note to 26, 73.

adspectu oculorum, gen. subj., seems to have been used by uo
other author except Ennius (Acad. ii. 17, 52).

ille—pereyriuctbatur, sc. auimo. His numerous writings embraced
all the scientific subjeets of those days.

Homerum coecum fuisse. Cicero purposely avoids the question of
the truth or falsehood of this tradition.

ejus picturam, uon poesin, is explained by what follows. So H. in
Athen. iv. 182, is compared to an ἀγαθὸς ζωγράφος, and called by
Lucian. Imag. ii. p. 6, ὁ ἄριστος τῶν γραφέων.

aut cuiquam docto, ‘⁴ or generally ;'’ see note to i. 30, 74.

115. Auaoeayoras of Clazomenae (i. 43, 104) gave up his patrimony
to his relations and went to Athens, where he lived until his 115111511-
ment. He died at Lampsacus.

Democritus, see note to i. ll, 22, and iv. 19, 44.

Polyphemum. The words which Cicero puts into the mouth of the
Cyclops are not really in Homer : perhaps he had read them in some
other oet.

ejus-gua laudare fortunas. The infin. after flzcere, instead of the
partc'p. (see iv. 16, 35, at impendere), is the more remarkable, be·
cause it is preceded by colloquentem. For the plural fhrtunas, in-
stead of the singular, cf. p. Sulla 23, 66 : Et secundas ‘fortunas amu-
lere coactus est et in (adversis sinc ullo remedio per›1z‹1uere,· Caesar Β.
Gall. ν. 3 : se suas ci citatisque-tortarius ejus fidei permissurum.

as well as stupid.
