SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS.

ΤΗΕ Prooemium (cap. 1—4) treats of Cicero’s proposed plan for
rendering the Greek philosophy accessible to his countrymen by
means of a Latin version.

The object of the Disputatio itself (cap. 5-46) is to refute the
notion <brought forward at cap. 5. ἓ 9) that death is an evil.

In the first place Cicero proves, that death, considered as utter
annihilatio 11, is not an evil either to the dead or to the living.

Secondly‚ he shews that death, if the soul be immortal, so
far from being an evil, is rather a good. After mentioning the various
opinions of philosophers respecting the nature of death and of the
soul (cap. 9—11), he goes on to prove the immortality of the soul,
first from historical evidence (cap. liz—15), secondly (after explain-
ing his own views respecting a future lise, and refuting the opinions
of other philosophers, cap. 16—22)‚0n metaphysical grounds (cap.
23—27), and, lastly, he examines the objections raised by different
parties (cap. 26—33).

T h i r d ly, the consideration of the question, whether death be an
evil, is resumed, and fresh arguments are adduced in justification of
his own opinion that such is not the case.

Since, then, there is no reason to fear death under any circum-
stances whatever, we ought to look forward with indifference to the
termination of our earthly career, and to take virtue as the sole rule
of our conduct.

Finally‚ in the Epilogus (cap. 47-49), he proves the correctness
of his views from various decisions pronounced by the gods, and
from the example of many illustrious men, who have cheerfully
sacrific-ed their lives for the good of their country.

Ι. l. ahfensionum¹ laboribus. Cicero does not mention the accusa-
tiones, because the object of most of his orations was the defenee of
accused parties, which was considered a more honorable duty than
the prosecution of offenders.

mayna er parte. For he had defended Ligarius (3.0. 46) and
Dejotarus (nc. 45). The only orations of Cicero, delivered subse-
quently to the publication of the Tusculanae, were his Philippies.
