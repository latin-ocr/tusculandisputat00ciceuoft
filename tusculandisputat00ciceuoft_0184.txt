52. nimirum, “in any case,” “undoubtedlyss' is formed out of ni
(sc. esset), and mirum (foret). In the same manner, sin minus, sin
aliter, or simply sin, are used without a verb, to express an alter-
native.

ut se quisque noscat. Γνῶθι σεαυτόν was placed over the entrance
of the temple at Delphi. The saying is ascribed to Chilon (Chilo) of
Lacedaemon, one of the seven wise men of Greeee.

oredo, inserted in this manner (without ut), generally gives a
more or less ironical colouring to the sentence. Cf. 44, 105 ι opinor
lias the same effect, 36, 87, and 38, 92.

Neque nos copora sumus. De Rep. vi 24: Neo enim tu is es, quem

proeceptum, sic ἰιι trib. deo sit, ‘⁶ that precept would not have been
given by some aeuter intellect [than that of meu in generaIJ, so that
it has been attributed to a god.” This is the usual emendation of the
MS. reading sic ut tributum a deo sithoc se ipsam posse coynoscere, which
would not make sense in this passage. What Cicero meant may be
easily ascertained by comparing the passage with V. 25, 70, de Fin.
v. 16, 44, and de Leg. i.22‚ 58. Since several words must be struck
out, the most simple plan would be to read, non esset hoo acrioris
cujusdam animi praeceptum tributum deo.

XXIII. numquam ne mov. quidem desinit. Here the two negatives
