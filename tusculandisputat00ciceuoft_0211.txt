avoid it, Tregder would read, verbis yloriabundum. Nihil, διο. We
should prefer simply cancelling the dum, and connecting, as he does,
, Nihil, &c., with what follows.

tare—docere, “to cherish a pious hope,” “to adduce proofs.”
So de Fato, 20, 47 : Optare hoo quidem est, non disputate,- Aoad. ii.

ἶ 38, 121 ε Somnia lzoec esse Democriti non docentis, sed optantis.

Hoc posito, διο. The sense is, “ health also and riches are goods,
but insignificant as compared with moral good3 pain, poverty, &c.,
are evils, but insignificant as compared with moral evil.’'

31. nihil est plane dolor, that is, as compared with moral evil.

animi inductione, ‘⁶ in consequence of your resolution ;” so ad Fam.
i. 8, 2: tantum enim animi inductio apud me calet, υτ- 3 cf. v. 10, 30:
inducere animum with the infinitive.

Prudentiamne, διο. Prudentia, temperantia, justitia, fortitudo, are
the four so-called cardinal virtues. Cf. de Off. i. 5.

m'lzit proficientem et laborantem, which would be the case if we gave
way to pain ; et, “and yet.‘'

32. respondebis, ‘⁶ will meet their demands.'’

jacens, so iv. 16, 35 ε oeqritudine quis afflictus, debilitatus, jacens.

Amittenda, “must be sacrificed.” So sometimes praedam, occa-
sionem amittere. Cf. ad Her. iv. 44, 57 ε (Decius) amisit eitam, at non

rdidit.
μεερείἱεηάτιε, “ must be laid in the grave,'' z “must be suppressed ;”
p. L. Man. 11, 30: bellum Pompeii adventu sublatum ac sepultum.

XIV. Ecquid scis, &c., a carrying out of the idea Amittenda—dolor.

de Corinthiis tuis, sc. vasis or operibns. Corinthiam vessels, east in
what was called Corinthian brass, a mixture of the nobler metals,
were in great request at Rome, and often eost more than vessels
of old.

ngulZam esse te nab„ the doctrine of the Stoics.

sed takes up the interrupted idea (as above, at 1, 3), and at the
same time corrects it.

33. aut Pham. illum. This passage is variously explained. Klotz
supposes that aut, with another noun, must have dropped out.
Kiihner, that Cicero intended aut te to follow, but afterwards substi-
tuted a te enim malo discedere. The simplest and best emendation
would be to strike out the aut.

,lecto—quod. All the best MSS. have this readingg only a few of
inferior authority have qui (probably a conjectural reading, and also
objectionable on account of the metre). Lectum,as a neuter noun, is
found only in Ulpian. We must understand it here of the whole
cave of Phil„ not of his bed alone. Tregder, therefore, after
Bouhier and others, would read tectum, but perhaps saxum would be
the better reading. Cf. de Fin. ii. 29, 94: Turpe putandum est, non
dico dolere, sed saxum illud Lemnium clamore Philocteteo funestare,
Quod ejulatu—refert. The verses are from Accius, who has
copied the Phil. of AEschylus.

mutum, “albeit dumb,” in conjunction with resonando voces refert,
produces au elegant ὀξὺμωρον. The other reading, multum, is feeble
m com aneon.

quidpexornamus philosqolziam? So above 5, 12 ε ne philosophiam
falsa gloria exornes.
