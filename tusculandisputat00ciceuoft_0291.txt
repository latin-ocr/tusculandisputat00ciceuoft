117, 1183 xm. 119.] Boon v. 283

malo audiebat as opposed to surdaster affords an elegant jeu ‘de
mots 3’ for male audire is = κακῶς ἀκούειν, to have a bad name.
Α Transl. t “that he heard no good of himself.''
Epicurei before 'nostri is in all the MSS. strictly speaking Nostri
would have been sufficient (as opposed to G-roeci) 3 but by the addi-
, tion of this word Cicero at the same time gives a side cut to the
fashionable philosophers of his time, by making them the representa—
tives of a defective system of edueation. This explanation, however,
seems far-fetched, and therefore Davis’s conjecture, Operasrii nostri,
deserves attention.

nec Gravi Latine, supply sciunt, from the preceding word, nesciunt,
as Acad. ii. 47, 146: Ita tu nnnc, Catule, lucere nescis, nec tn, Hor-
tensi, in tua villa nos esse. Cf. Zumpt, ἓ 774, and Seyffert ad Lael. S.
371, sq.

omnesque id nos. Anaeoluthon. Cicero at first intended that only
sumus should follow, but afterwards added surdi profecto sumus as an
explanation of id.

117. paullo ante, 38, 111.

secum loqui, as at 36, 103.

primum. The corresponding word here is sin forte. Cf. note to
i. 13, 30.

Portas proesto est. Cf. i. 30, 74.

ibidem, ‘⁶ when our sufferings are most severe.”

nihil sentiendi receptaculum, “affords us the relies of eternal un-
consciousness.'’ Cf. i. 43, 102, de nihil sentiendo,

Theodorus, see note to i. 43, 103.

vero, ‘⁶ upon my word,” ironical.

cantharidis rim. Κανθαρὶς, a venomous beetle, “Spanish fly.’'
often used as poison by the ancients. Thence ad Fam. ix. 21, 3:
cantharidas sumpisse dicitur.

118. Persi, instead of Perseo. With the exception of this form
Cicero always makes this name Perses (l decl.)‚· cf. iii. 22, 53.

In tna-potestate est, i. e. “you can escape it, if you please, by
kining yourself.’'

haud sane, see note to 36, 103, periculum est = timendum est.

XLI. obtinetur, not obtinet, as Orelli and Tregder would read 011
the authority of two MSS. 3 for obtinere is never used by Cicero as
an intransitive verb. Cf. i. 12, 26.

aut bibat aut abeat. Graeee, ὴ πῖθι ὴ ἄπιθι, like the German,
“saus oder lauf !''

inquit, “it is said.” Fr. “ on dit,'' without a subject. So de Leg.
ii. 24, 60: Cetera funebria, quibus luctus auyetur, duodecim sustulerunt.
Homini, inquit, mortuo ne ossa leqito, quo post sanus jacim,- cf. p.
Cluent. 34, 92.

violentiam vinolentorum. Cf. iii. 27, 64, verbis—verberibus.

nequeas, see note to ii. 27, 65, and above 37, 108, queant.

Hieronymus, see note to ii. 6, 18.

119. Quod si his philosophis. A very remarkable anacoluthon.
The sentence should have been continued thus: tamen licet, semper
beatum censere esse sapientem ; instead of which the meaning is con—
veyed in the parenthesis, to which the concluding words are ap-
pcnded.
