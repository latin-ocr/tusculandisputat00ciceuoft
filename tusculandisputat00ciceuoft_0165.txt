would rise above mediocrity, must acquire an accurate know-
ledge of Greek literature and philosophy. The result of this con-
· viction was, that he engaged as an instructor, first, the Epicurean
philosopher Phaedrus, and then the Academia, Philo of Larissa, a
man to whose opinions, until his mind was enfeebled by extreme

- old age, he continued to attach the greatest importance. At the

same time he received instruction in Dialectics from the Stoie Dio-
dotus, who lived and died in his house.

Cicero entered on public life as an orator in the year B.c. 81 3 but
the eagerness with which he applied himself to the discharge of his
professional duties soon brought on an illuess, which compelled him to
visit Greece for the re-establishment of his health. During his sojourn
at Athens, he studied under the Academic philosopher Antiochus,
attending occasionally the lectures of the Epicureans, Phaedrus and
Zeno. From Atheus he went to Rhodes, where he studied under
the rhetorician Molo, and the Stoic philosopher Posidonius. After
two years spent in visiting different parts of Asia, he returned
to Rome, where his el‹›quence, improved as it had been by his phi-
losophical and rhetorical studies, soon obtained for him the repu-
tation of being the first orator of his day. Notwithstanding, how-
ever, his eminence as a political speaker, the part which he was
compelled to play, under a government so corrupt and degraded as
that of the Roman republic in those days, was often of a very sub-
ordinate character: relinquishing, therefore, a pursuit which now
seemed almost discreditable, he devoted himself exclusively to the
study of philosophy, in the hope of producing some work which
should at the same time increase his own reputation and confer
an important benefit on his countrymen.

The periods, during which our orator was thus compelled, by un-
toward circumstances, to withdraw for a season from public life,
were two in number: the first, when the republic under the first
triumvirate was in so unsettled a state, as to render his attempts to
restore order well-nigh hopeless ; the second, when, under the die-
tatorship of Caesar aud the consulate of Antony, no place worthy of
his high reputation was offered to him by the government. During
the first of these periods he produced his treatises de Republica
(B.c. 54) and de Leyz'bus (B.c. 52); in the second (from 13.c. 45) he
published the rest of his philosophical works. Whilst, however,
he was thus employed, we have sufficient evidence from those very
writings, aud especially from his letters to Atticus, that the eyes
of the philosopher were still directed towards that political arena
from which he was for a season excluded.

Under such circumstances we can readily imagine, that the only
philosophical system which he would be likely to adopt would be a
moderate scepticism, which oscillated between different opinions, in
the same manner as the life of Cicero was alternately a renunciation
and pursuit of political reputation and power. Hence, the pre—
ference which he manifested for the principles of the New Academy,
a preference which was strengthened by his observation, particularly
during his resideuce at Athens, of the manner in which the different
schools disputed with one another. Το investigate these various
opinions, for the purpose of obtaining at least au approximation to
