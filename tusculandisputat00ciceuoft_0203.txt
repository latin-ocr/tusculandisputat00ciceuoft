11. By what means pain may be overeome (cap. 14—27).
The means recommended by Cicero for the attainment of this end
Δ are z-l. Praetice and habit (cap. 14—17). 2. The exercise of
reason, especially self-controul‚ the contemplation of illustrious
exampleS, exertion of the mind, sense of honour (cap. 18-27, 65).
, By way of conclusion the result of the Disputation is again briefly
stated (cap. 27, 66, 67).

Ι. l. apud Ennium, in the lost tragedy of “ Neoptolemus.” Paucis
phil„ “to make short work of philosophy ;'' “ to meddle a little, and but
a little with it ;” omnino phil„ ‘⁶ to devote one's whole attention to it.’'
Cf. Callicles in Plato, Gorg. p. 484, c: Φιλοσοφία γάρτοι ἐστὶ χάριεν.
ἅν τις αὐτοῦ μετρίως ἅψηται ἐν τῇ ἡλικίᾳ. ἐὰν δὲ περαιτέρω τοῦ
δέοντος ἐνδιατρίψῃ, διαφθορὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων.

nihil aqens, ayere- melius, an elegant ὀξύμωρον. Nihil dens refers
to Cicero's taking no part in politics. Cf. i. l, l.

2. nm’lti habita est. There is here a soul of modesty in the use of
the dat. commodi, instead of ab, with the passive verb, the agent
being as it were thrown into the background.

3. Etenim si orationes. This should be followed (after the paren-
thesis) by non probatoe sunt a nonnullis, qui nihil laudarent, &e Such
anacolutha as this (sed si reperiebantur nonnulli) render the language
more lively, and in many instances clearer.

sperandi sihi—bene dicendi finem. Orator. 7, 24: IVuno tantum quis-
que laudat, qua-ntum se sperat posse imitari. A delicate mode of
charging his adversaries with the want of a talent which he himself
possessed in the highest degree. It was not, however, altogether
without reason, that they complained of the eloquence of his earlier
orations as being too “ Asiatic.''

unde, “ from which principle,” “from which opinion.”

§enus Atticorum. There were three sorts of eloquence: l. The
Asiatic, pompous in thought and language. 2. The Attio, simple and
rational (as exemplified in the orations of Lysias) 3 and 3. The
Rhodian, which occupied a middle position between the other two.
Among those who found fault with Cicero were many orators‚ who
wished to be Attio, but were only jejune, lame, and nerveless. See
Brutus, 82. Orator. 7 aud 23, and de Opt. Gen. Orat.

4. secundo populo z <mentiente populo. See de Leg. Agr. ii. 37, 101 :
secunda contione leyem madere.

in eam, the doctrine of the Academy.

ΙΙ. in Hortensio, a dialogue (unfortunately lost) in which the cele-
brated orator Hortensius attacked, and Cicero triumphantly defended,
the study of philosophy.

in Acad.-lil›r2·s. Of the original work, which consisted of two
books of considerable length, only the second is extant3 and of the
four books of a later edition, only the first: consequently there is an
hiatus in the middle of the work.

5. quw—expetendoe. Cicero's usual excuse sor the little attention
paid by the Romans to the arts and sciences. Cf. i. l, l.

ad nihilum ventura. The destruction of political freedom was soon

point of view than would have been the case with a particle. As
