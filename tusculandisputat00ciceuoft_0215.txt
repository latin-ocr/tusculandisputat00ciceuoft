to aye, aqite, dic, mane, abi, ἀρ.

Bene plane muyans, “ certainly of considerable magnitude.'’ The
more usual arrangement would be to place plane before bene.

possunt oculi, se. dolere.

45. catus, “ crafty,” although found in few of the codd„ is not only
more suitable than cautus, but has also the testimony of Nonius
(p. 92, ed. Mero.) in its favour. Cicero, it is true, elsewhere, offers
an excuse for the use of this antiquated word, e. g. de Leg. i. 16, 45,
ut ita dicam5 but he is not always consistent in such matters

quamvis—proebeat, in a letter to Hermarchus, which Cicero criti-
cizes, de Fin. ii. 30.

yloria, subjective, “ the pursuit of glory‚’' “ ambition.” So below,
27, 65, studio et 9loria; p. Rab. Post. 14, 38 : ostentatio et yloria. So
officium, “ a sense of duty ;'' veritas, “ a love of truth‚'’ διο.
