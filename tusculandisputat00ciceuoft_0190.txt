qua proridentes, an anacoluthon for qua prorident; sor moriantur,
strictly speaking, belongs to cyqni. So Brut. 27, 105 ε hunc qui audi-
erant, in quibus L. Gellius canorum oratorem fuisse dicebat, for in quibus
L. G.fuit,—dicebant.

qui quum-intuerentur. Another instance of stylistic negligenee.
Quum must either be suppressed, or we must substitute simply atitise-
runt for zet-amitterent.

se ipsa intuens. We should have expected here se ipsam intuens.
See Zumpt, § 696 [Pr. Intr. 368J.

reverens for timens is rare. In Cicero we find it only in this pas-

bella soepe quoesierunt propter ylorloe cupiditatem.

πω, in Cicero, is always joined to a pronoun. So 42, 49, and
iii. 4 8.

au't ab aliqua potestate. Aliquis is not = alius quis, as some grmn-
marians suppose 3 but aut aliquis = ‘ or, generally, some ' [‘ or smne—
or other? an emphatic ‘some']. Cf. iii. 14, 29 : aut aliquam molem
mali; ib. 19, 44 ε aut aliquid ejusmodi.

commentatio mortis, ‘⁶ contemplation of death, preparation sor
death.'' Cf. ii. 18, 42, and iii. 16, 34. Plat. Phaed. p. 67, D: Τὸ

thus by Cicero, to avoid the pentameter termination. Cf. 43, 103 ;

dicitur vita, mors est,- and Euripides: τίς οἶδεν, εἰ τὸ ζῆν μέν ἐστι
κατθανεῖν, τὸ κατθανεῖν δὲ ζῆν ;

which is a more palpable good.”
