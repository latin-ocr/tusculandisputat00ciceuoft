ut libido sit, &c. We must supply desiderium as the subject. The
sense is : “ There is also this distinction between desiderium (πόθος)
aud indiyentia (σπάνις), that des. is used in a more extended sense,
to signify the longing (libido) for whatever is predicated of things
(κατηγόρημα),3,ι]ἀ indigentia the longing after the things themselves.
For example, we must say desidero habere pecuniam, and not desidero
pecuniam, and vice vers53 indiyeo pecunia, not indiyeo habere pecu-
niam.” He is quite right as regards indiyere, but not as regards
desiderare.
