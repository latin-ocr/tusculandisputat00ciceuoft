SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS.

IN the Prooemium Cicero first speaks of human infirmity‚ which
often, when we are in misfortune, misleads us as to the truth of the
dogma, that ‘⁶ virtue is in itself sufficient for happiness,’' then praises
philosophy as an auxiliary in this case also; and concludes with some
remarks on its history (cap. 1—4).

The Disputation itself is directed, in the first instance, against
the thesis of the A., that “ virtue is not sufficient sor a happy life,'’
which is briefly resuted by the argument that there can be no happi-
ness without freedom from passion, and that this can only be attained
by means of virtue; consequently, it is virtue alone which can make
a man happy (cap. 5 and 6). Then follows arefutation of the illogical
reasoning of the Academics and Peripatetics, who held that there
were three sorts of goods, and yet maintained that virtue alone was
sufficient to lead us, is not to the highest happiness, yet to happiness

ca . 7—12).

< (licere then resum es the consideration of the dogma that virtue
makes us happy, and establishes its truth by a series of prooss and
examples. He shews that virtue leads, not only to happineSS, but to
perfect happiness, even in the midst of the severest bodily suffering
(ca ). 13—28 .

Iln conclu) sio n he endeavours to prove that the contradictory
notions of the supreme good entertained by different schools need
not be any obstacle to a general agreement on this point.

both as regards the subject—matter‚and the way in which it is treated.
It seems to have been dashed off, as it were, at one stroke, oon amore.”

than with the dative.
