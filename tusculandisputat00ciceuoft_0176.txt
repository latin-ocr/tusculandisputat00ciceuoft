168 NOTES. [x. xi. 23, 24,

three books περὶ ψυχῆς (probably Ξ Κορινθιακοί) ; also three
Λεσβιακοί. Cf. 31, 77.
animalia et animantes. The former of the two antithetical terms
= ζῶα) signifies men and beasts ; the latter (z ἔμψυχα) plants.-—
erhaps ‘⁴ living creatures‚” “things possessing life.'' [or, ‘ the
animal ancl veqecable kinqdoms.']

animum vai animam, neither a spiritual soul, nor a physical one,
separable from the body.

temperatione, “organization.’' Cf. l, 2, and 28, 68; iv. 1, l, and
13, 30.

22. quattuor—yenera principiorum, the so—oalled four elements,
στοιχεῖα, first established by Empedocles.

e qua sit mens. This is not the doctrine of Aristone. The fifth
clement, according to that philosopher, is the substance of which the
heavenly bodies (τὰ αἰθέρια) are composed. In this and other pas-
sages, where Cicero speaks of the spirit as the fifth element (17, 41 ;
26, 65; Acad. i. 7, 26; de Fin. iv. 5, 12), he has been misled by the.
uotion of the Stoics that the heavenly bodies are spirits.

ἐνδελέχεια. Another mistake. Aristotle does not call the spirit
ἐνδελέχεια, but ἐντελέχεια; and Cicero’s explanation suits only the
first word, and that but indifferently ; for Aristotle, de Anima, i. 3,
expressly denies motion to the soul.

XI. Democritum. This philosopher (born at Abdera, 13.c. 460) fully
carried out the atomio system of his master, Leucippus Cf. de Nat.
D. i. 24, 66 ε Ista enim flas-(sicia Democriti siz-e etiam ante Leucippi, esse
covpuscula qmedam lez-ici (λεῖα), alia aspera, rotunda alia, partim au-
tem aizqnlata, curi-ata qzioedam et quasi adunca : cn lais qff'aotmn esse
coelum <itque terram, nulla ooyente natura, sed concursu quodavnjbrluito.

apud istos, among the Atomists, whom Epicurus followed.

23. <leus alz’qui. So iv. 16, 35, and v. 2l, 61, aliqui terror. On the
other hand wc find, i. 34, 82, aliquis dolor,· and ii. 20, 46, dolor
ali uis.

ἔπιεν licis sententias diiudicare. Cf. de Orat. i. 39, 176: inter Mar-
cellos et Claudios centumviri judicarunt.

si posset, sc.ficri, as 31, 77, Qui potest? and iv. 18,41, id non polest.

confundere, ‘⁶ to unite the two.'’ So cle Fin. v. 23, 67 : confusio vir·
tutum.

si videtur hei-e and at 32, 77, without (but often also with) tibi,
which, on the other hand, is always omitted after si placet (e. g. b. iii.
6, 13, and v. 31, 88), and uisi molestum est (e. g. b. i. 12, 26).

quaecunque-sit. The subjunctive in this passage is found in all
the MSS. Cf. pro Flacco 8, 19: Mirandmn vero est, hominm eos—
libenter arripere facultatem loedendi, quaecmzqiie decim where all the
MSS. have detur, and it may be justified as standing in a clause
dependent on a subjunctive.

24. quasi in domicilium suum. Cf. de Seu. 23, 84 ι ea: vita ita di-
suedo tamqnam ea: hospitio, non tamquam e domo: commorandi enim
natura deversorium nobis, non habitandi locum dedic.

vero affirmative, as in ἓ 25; 23, 55; 32, 76; 43, 103, διο.

qui est de animo, “which treats of the soul.'' Esse [not ayero] is
the usual expression in such titles. Cf. iv. 34, 72. Cicero means the
dialogue entitled Φαίδων.
