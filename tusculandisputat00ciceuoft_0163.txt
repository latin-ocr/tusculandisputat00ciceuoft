INTRODUCTION.

VERY little attention was paid by the ancient Romans to the.
cultivation of the arts and sciences until the middle of the second
century before the Christian era3 when three Athenian philoso-
pherS, Carneades an Academic, Critolaus a Peripatetic, and Diogenes
a Stoic, availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by a politieal
mission to Rome (B.c. 155) to deliver lectures in that city on the
language and philosophy of Greece. These lectures, it is true, were
brought to an abrupt conclusion, in consequence of the unexampled
rapidity with which their public business was despatched, through
the jealous interference of Cato the Censor, and other citizens of the
old school ; but enough had been done among the younger Romans
to create a taste which was mainly instrumental in bringing about
a gradual revolution in the character and habits of the nation.
In Scipio Africanus the Younger, his friend C. Laelius the Wise,
Q. AElius Tuben), Q. Mucius Scaevola, and other young men of the
noblest families, who had attended the lectures of the Athenian
envoys, and were afterwards on terms of the closest intimacy with
the Stoic philosopher Panaetius, the Romans witnessed the first ex-
ample of friendly intercourse between their countrymeu and the
philosophers and learned men of (Jreece. Panaetius was soon sol-
lowed by Athenian philosophers of other sehools, who either esta-
blished themselves permanently, or were sojourners for a time at
Rome. Of the various seets, the most popular among the Romans
were the Stoic (in which the nobler spirits sought a refuge from
the general corruption of manners which at that time prevailed)
and the Epicurean. In Cicero's time, the philosophy of the later Aca-
deiny was taught at Rome by Philip of Larissa, and even the Peri-
patetic school had some sollowers among the most highly educated
citizens The most prominent among the disciples of the later
Academic school (under Antiochus os Ascalon) were M. Brutus, the
famous conspirator against Julius Caesar, and M. Terentius Varro, a
man of universal learning; both contemporaries of Cicero. The Stoica]
system, 011 the other hand, was recommended to the Romans by
the strictness with which M. Porcius Cato the Younger carried out
its principles during his lise and in his death. The most distin-
guished Epicureans at that period were T. Pomponius Atticus, the
intimate friend of Cicero, C. Cassius, one of the assassins of Caesar,
L. Torquatus, and C. Vellejus. The two last are introduced by
Cicero, in his treatises on the Supreme Good and the Nature
